Search by actor
Look up actor using The Movie Database actor api
Filter by age rating (PG, PG13, etc)
Play around with all the GET endpoints.  
Users can save movies to a list? Share the list? Send lists to each other?
Find times the movie is playing near them based on phone location, or can input location (if headed somewhere, meeting someone for example)


I want the bottom bar where you can click “Top Rated” or “Popular” to be a sideways scroll to get more options where the options are basically all the endpoints offered by the GET options.

	Network error provides tic-tac-toe game https://medium.com/swift-programming/build-tic-tac-toe-with-ai-using-swift-25c5cd3085c9#.1vhj2mc78
		go-to-tic-tac-toe, and hide/dismiss it when you get a successful connection, with notification message, so might need that in another hidden view
		- read up on memory expense of hidden views vs inactive view controllers

3.5hrs of troubleshooting - put those in total time to build? they weren’t actually building, more destroying :(
